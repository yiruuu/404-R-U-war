            <p> The MP-448 Skyph is the latest improvement of the Makarov pistol, developed by the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant (IzhMech, or Baikal) in the late 1990s. The gun has an engineered plastic base and a cast steel firing mechanism with an improved and more reliable safety mechanism. The use of engineering plastics makes the Skyph a lighter pistol than the Maglov, and its shape is more ergonomic. This model is primarily intended for export and is available in two calibres.</p>
