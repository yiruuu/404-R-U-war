            <p> The GP-30 is an improvement on the GP-25, with a slight weight reduction and some shortening of the overall length, but the barrel length remains unchanged and the tactical performance is identical. The existing GP-25 is still in use by the Russian Army, so the manufacturer is mainly targeting foreign trade. The GP-30 is also fitted with the VOG-25 series of anti-personnel grenades.</p>
