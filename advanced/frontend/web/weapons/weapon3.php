            <p> The first prototype of the Dragunov sniper rifle (for convenience, the SVD-1958) differed from the model later finalised in 1963 in both the stock and the wood guard. The SVD-1958 also has a sight door positioned above the rear of the receiver, a sight design taken directly from the AK-47, and no flameproofing at the muzzle. The gun is very accurate, but not reliable, and needs a lot of improvement</p>
