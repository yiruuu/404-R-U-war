            The RPK-74 has a long 45-round magazine, but this is fully compatible with the original 30-round magazine, so the RPK-74 can also be used with the rifle's 30-round magazine, and the head of the terrorist group al-Qaeda, Bin Laden, is often seen in public photographs and video footage with an AKS-74U fitted with a 45-round magazine. Kalashnikov also designed a 75-round drum, but no RPK-74s have been seen with this type of drum.
